  description: >-
    <b><h2>API Overview</h2></b><br>Restful API are supported in Device42 as one of the
    primary methods of entering, editing and retrieving data.<br><br> The API
    documentation has samples in curl for now and we will be adding other
    programming languages in future. You can refer to our github repositories at
    https://github.com/device42 for some sample code in python.<br><br> The
    RESTful API's enforce the role-based security that is created with the
    Device42 app. If you want a user to have access via the API, but not via the
    UI - deselect 'Staff Status' for that user from UI Tools > Admins &
    Permissions > Administrators.<br><br>If you'd like to see your changes on
    our UI, please visit http://swaggerdemo.device42.com and use credentials 'guest:device42_rocks!'.
    Please be aware that every 30 minutes our database resets and all data
    entered with POST/PUT calls from this page will be lost.<br><br>If you have
    any questions/suggestions, please send us a note to support at device42.com
    below. <br><h2><a id = 'Sample_API_Code'><b>Sample API Code</b></a></h2> <b>Sample
    Code with API Calls in the Python and .Net Programming Languages.</b><br>The
    following programs written in the Python programming language are available
    at <a href=
    'https://github.com/device42/Device42-AutoDiscovery-Scripts'>Device42 sample
    programs</a><br><ul><li>api-sample.py: Runs against a single Windows system
    and uploads info to device42 appliance.</li><li>ad-sample.py: Can run
    against Active directory computers, servers or a given list and upload
    discovered systems’ info to device42
    appliance.</li><li>d42_api_linux_upload_sample_script.py: Runs on a single
    *nix based system and uploads info to device42
    appliance.</li><li>sample-script-facter-facts-to-d42: Runs on puppet master
    and uploads nodes info from facter fact files to device42
    appliance.</li><li>d42_api_solaris_sample_script.py: Runs on an individual
    solaris system and uploads info to device42 appliance.</li></ul>The
    csv2d42apis.py sample program shows how to create a CSV file of data to
    import into device42. It reads a CSV file, matches columns to arguments for
    APIs and sends data to device42 via POST or PUT. This program can be found
    at: <a href= 'https://github.com/device42/API_Helpers'> Device42 sample CSV
    importer</a>.<br><br>The Auto Discovery Client source code can be found at
    Device42 <a href='https://docs.device42.com/auto-discovery/'>Auto Discovery
    Client</a>. This is a .net program that uses the device42 Restful API’s to
    load the discovered data.<h2><a id = 'Response_Status_Messages'><b>Response &
    Status Messages</b></a></h2><b>Responses</b><br>The response to most POST calls
    will have the following format: <br>{'msg':['PartModel added/updated', 17,
    'RAM Acme 123456', true, true], 'code':0}<br><br>Using the example
    above:<br>'17' = ID of the object<br>'RAM Acme 123456' = representation of
    the object<br> 'true, true' = object added and is new.<br>'true, false' =
    object updated.<br>'false, false' = no changes.<br><br><b>Status
    Codes</b><br><u>Code 0</u><br>Success! e.g. = {'msg': 'device added or updated',
    <b>code:0</b>}<br><br><u>'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'</u><br>Success! All other responses are
    errors and will display an error code e.g.: 400, 401, 403, 405, 410, 500, 503. These are explained
    in each call.<br><br>Please let us know if you notice something odd with a response and we will fix it! :)
    <h2><a id = 'Get_Limits_Offsets'><b>API Get Limits and Offsets</b></a></h2>In
    Device42’s global settings we have the option to enforce API GET limits and
    this setting is recommended for better performance. To set this value from
    Device42, go to Tools>Settings>Global Settings and the click Edit in the top
    right. Toward the bottom of the screen you will see the API section. First
    check the “Enforce API GET Limits” checkbox, then enter a value for API GET
    Limit. A good limit to start with is 500 or 1000, depending on the
    performance you experience.<br><br>After setting this limit all GET calls
    below can have the results augmented via “offset” and “limit” parameters to
    tell Device42 which value to start returning results from, and how many
    results to return at maximum.<br>Examples:<br><br>'/?limit=50' returns the
    first 50 results.<br><br> '/?offset=100' will start at the 100th result.
    <br><br>'/?offset=42&limit=42' returns 42 results, starting at the 42nd.
